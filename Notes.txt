Notes

ng-app directive is used to flag the HTML element that Angular should consider to be the root element of our application.

There are 3 important things that happen during the bootstrap phase:
1.The injector that will be used for dependency injection is created.
2.The injector will then create the root scope that will become the context for the model of our application.
3.Angular will then "compile" the DOM starting at the ngApp root element, processing any directives and bindings found along the way.
